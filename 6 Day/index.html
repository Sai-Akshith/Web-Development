<!--SEO - Search Engine Optimization  SEO involves optimizing various aspects of a website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs), thereby increasing the visibility of the website to potential visitors.-->

<!--Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers crucial for user experience on the web.-->

<!--Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is one of the Core Web Vitals, focusing on visual stability. It measures the sum total of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page.

What is a Layout Shift?
A layout shift happens any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. For example, when a user is reading an article and an image suddenly loads above the text, causing the text to move down, this is a layout shift. Such shifts can be disruptive to the user experience.-->

<!--LCP - Largest Contentful Paint  
Importance of LCP
LCP is a critical metric because it helps understand how quickly the main content of a page is rendered, which directly affects user experience. A fast LCP can make users feel that the site is loading quickly and efficiently, while a slow LCP can lead to frustration and higher bounce rates.-->

<!--FID - First Input Delay
First Input Delay (FID) is one of the Core Web Vitals metrics that measures interactivity. Specifically, FID quantifies the time from when a user first interacts with a page (such as by clicking a link, tapping a button, or using a custom JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.-->
<!--In summary, the <meta> tag is versatile and essential for providing metadata that helps improve SEO, control how your web page is displayed, and ensure the correct rendering of the page across different devices and browsers.-->
